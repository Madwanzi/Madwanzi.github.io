/* 5. Make sure to test your website after making these changes to ensure that all styles are applied correctly.

6. If you have any specific styles that need to be preserved or any additional styles that should be added, let me know, and I can help you with that as well. 7. Once you've completed these steps, you can further optimize your CSS by using tools like CSS Minifier to reduce the file size and improve loading times.

8. Additionally, consider using CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS if you want to take advantage of variables, nesting, and other features that can make your styles more maintainable.

9. If you have any specific components or sections that require unique styles, you can create separate classes in the `styles.css` file to keep everything organized.

10. Finally, remember to keep your CSS file updated as you make changes to your HTML files to ensure consistency across your website. If you need further assistance or have questions about specific styles, feel free to ask! 11. Once you have your `styles.css` file linked in your HTML files, you can also consider using a CSS reset or normalize stylesheet at the beginning of your CSS file to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

12. If you want to implement responsive design, make sure to use media queries effectively to adjust styles for various screen sizes.

13. You can also explore using CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout management, which can simplify your design and make it more adaptable to different devices.

14. If you have animations or transitions in mind, you can add those to your CSS to enhance user experience, but be mindful of performance and accessibility.

15. Lastly, always validate your CSS using tools like the W3C CSS Validation Service to catch any errors or warnings that could affect your website's appearance. If you have any more questions or need further guidance, just let me know! 1. Create a new file called `styles.css` in your project directory.

2. Copy and paste all the styles from the `<style>` tags in each HTML file into this new CSS file.

3. Remove duplicate styles and organize them logically.

4. In each HTML file, replace the `<style>` tag with a link to the new CSS file.
